# First Time User Guide   
# The Big Idea   
Video editing is a tedious process that can take hours. That's why we designed a video editor that's made to be faster and easier to learn. If you're someone coming from a traditional video editing software or this is your first time editing a video, this guide will give you an overview of how to edit with moonshine and get you started on creating your first moonshine project.   
# Creating a Project   
Lets get started by logging in and creating your first project by clicking the + Create New button and naming this project Hello World and hitting enter.

# Understanding the UI

In the header, double click the title to change your project's name and click on the home button to go back to the project page.   
   
In the timeline, the left hand toolbar has the timeline functionalities of cut, delete, duplicate and undo/redo buttons. You can control the zoom of the timeline with the slider and two buttons at the top. Pause and play the video using the large white play button. All new projects will start with a search box to search your footage. You need to upload footage before making searches. At the bottom of magic tracks, which are distinguished by the video icon with a plus, are a button to create a new search box.   
   
The view box has three buttons for aspect ratios. At the bottom is a button for auto center which brings the footage are into view.
